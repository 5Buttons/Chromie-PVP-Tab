## Chromie-PVP-Tab

This addon serves as a graphical wrapper for server-side commands, eliminating the need to manually type chat commands for arena queuing and setting management by adding a Chromie tab to the PVP frame.  

The announcement settings will persist between game sessions. Designed for the server Chromiecraft, but works on any server with the respective commands enabled.
